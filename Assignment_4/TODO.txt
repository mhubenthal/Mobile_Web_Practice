Assignment #4 TODOs:

1. Fix initial loading of total sightings map, which requires a refresh to render to full size (something to do with the jQuery Mobile hides each 'page').

2. Center top logo in a non-hacky way.

3. Figure out how to make bottom social icons inline.

4. Make sure that footer always sits at bottom of page.

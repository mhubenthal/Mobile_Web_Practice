Assignment #3 TODOs:

(Note: IndexedDB support is still limited, browser prefixes and fallbacks would be essential in production. Or possibly not using IndexedDB at all, maybe using localStorage combined with server-side storage.)

1. Add localStorage to app, to store and display the most recent search a user performed.

2. Fix column headers to display in small window.

3. Right now, the two tables ('locationData' and 'zipcodeData') duplicate three fields/columns between the two. This is to enable searching only one table and getting the info required for the UI. It may be a bit of a hack not suitable for production.

4. Find a way to test in a mobile phone (loading data may take quite awhile...).

Assignment #5 TODOs:

1. Figure out how to include two practice areas: 'OP' and 'UN'.

2. There are not enough employees from each combination of location/practice area for a full 10 rounds. Any amount less than 10 within particular constraints will be padded by selecting with ANY constraints.

3. Format game image for current question better. (Higher resolution image?)
